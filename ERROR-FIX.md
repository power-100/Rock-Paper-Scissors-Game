# 🛠️ **Error Fixed: "user is not defined"**

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Missing user destructuring in CreatePost**
- **Problem**: `user` was not imported from `useAuth()`
- **Fix**: Added `user` to the destructuring: `const { isAuthenticated, user } = useAuth();`

### **2. Added loading state handling**
- **Problem**: Form could be submitted before auth state was loaded
- **Fix**: Added loading check and spinner while auth loads

### **3. Added fallback values**
- **Problem**: Potential null reference errors
- **Fix**: Added fallback values for user data (user?.id || 'anonymous-user')

### **4. Improved error handling**
- **Fix**: Added ErrorBoundary to catch and display runtime errors gracefully

1. **No more runtime errors** when submitting the form
